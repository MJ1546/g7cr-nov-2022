1. keep a file, say, sw.js or serviceWorker.js in "public" folder
2. write the code about caching
3. create a file swDv.js in the src directory, with a function that registers the service worker in browser, when the application is running in production mode
4. fetch data using fetch api or asiox from jsontypicode.com/users link
5. keep the data in redux store
6. now run the application in production mode
    a. first build the application using "npm run build" command and 
    b. then host it using any server (such as serve or http-server)
7. you will notice the application is registering a service worker in the browser (check under Application tab)
8. initially the application displays the user data on Users.js component
9. Now, check the network tab in browser dev tool, set the network from "Throttling" to "Offline" mode and reload the application
10. you will notice that the Users component is still shoing the data (the data is being served from the cache). You will find the cached data under Application tab>Cache storage
11. change the code in sw.js file in order to cache whatever you want
